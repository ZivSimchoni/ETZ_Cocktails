# ETZ_Cocktails Description

ETZ Cocktails
First, what is cocktails and why did we choose that idea?

## What is a Cocktail?

A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink. Most commonly, cocktails are either a single spirit or combination of spirits, mixed with other ingredients such as juices, flavored syrups, tonic water, shrubs, and bitters.
In modern times, the term cocktail has also come to refer to any mixed drink that contains three or more ingredients, without a spirit.

## Why this idea?

We chose this idea because we love cocktails and we wanted to create an app that will help us and other cocktail lovers to find and save their favorite cocktails.

## What is the app about?

This is Android app that allows everyone search inside the CocktailsDB, either by cocktail name or an ingredient.
Our app allows the user to add custom recipes and save them locally.
The user also can mark as cocktails as favorite and view only the favorite cocktails (in a dedicated fragment).
Moreover, the user is also able to view the details of a cocktail (including the ingredients and the instructions) in a dedicated fragment.
Since cocktails vary in their alcohol content, we also added an option for the user to to create the recipes and mark the content as Alcoholic/Non-Alcoholic/Optional-Alcoholic.

## What is the app's target users?

Our target users are Any cocktail lover, mixologist or Bartender.
